							<h1 class="space-letters w3-text-pink"><b>FAQ</b></h1>

						</div>



						<p class='w3-text-black topp-margin'><b>Will I need to wait for the model to download every time I use the
								app?</b></p>

						<p>No. Once the model downloads it will be cached in memory. The next time you visit this site you won’t
							need to wait.</p>

						<p>That said, I suggest that you always use this tool with your web browser set to incognito mode. The model
							won’t be saved, but this will ensure that each time you visit this site you will always use the most up to
							date version of the model and not the old one that's stored in your device's memory.
						</p>



						<p class='w3-text-black topp-margin'><b>What about patient data privacy?</b></p>

						<p>Your images are never sent to an external server. Any image you submit stays on your computer or mobile
							phone. This is because the model is running on your device. This is also why a batch of images can be
							analyzed in less than two seconds.</p>

						<p>The tech that makes this possible is called Tensorflow.js. It was created by Google.</p>






						<p class='w3-text-black topp-margin'><b>What do the decimal numbers mean?</b></p>

						<p>They are probability scores between 0 and 1. They show how confident the model is that a particular
							condition is present on the image. <br>
							For example, <i>mel, Melanoma: 0.231</i> means that the model is 23% sure that the lesion shown in the
							image is melanoma.</p>






						<p class='w3-text-black topp-margin'><b>How do I use this app on a computer?
							</b></p>

						<p>- Go to this site on your computer.<br>
							- Click the orange button.<br>
							- Select one image or multiple images and click ‘Open’.<br>
							- The app will print results for each image.
						</p>





						<p class='w3-text-black topp-margin'><b>How do I use this app on a mobile phone?
							</b></p>

						<p>You can take a new photo or you can submit photos that are stored on your phone. The steps below apply to
							Android. iOS may be similar but I'm not sure.</p>

						<p class="w3-text-pink"><b>[ 1 ] Take a photo</b></p>
						<p>- Go to this site on your phone.<br>
							- Tap the orange button.<br>
							- Select “Camera”<br>
							- Take a photo<br>
							- Tap the "tick"<br>
							- The photo will be sent to the app for analysis.
						</p>


						<p class="w3-text-pink"><b>[ 2 ] Use images from your photo folder</b></p>
						<p>- Go to this site on your phone.<br>
							- Tap the orange button.<br>
							- Tap "Files"<br>
							- Tap the image name<br>
							- To submit a batch of images, tap each image (tick) to select it and then tap "Open".
						</p>




						<p class='w3-text-black topp-margin'><b> What would it take to make this tool more trustworthy?</b></p>

						<p>Three things are needed:<br>
							- Collaboration with a dermatologist/pathologist.<br>
							- More high quality labeled training data.<br>
							- Field testing.</p>

						<p>Ai systems can be brittle. Good training scores don't guarantee that a model will perform well under
							real-world conditions. This tool first needs to be field tested. Then the model needs to be re-trained to
							make it more robust.
