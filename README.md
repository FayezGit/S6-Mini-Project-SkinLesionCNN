# Skin Lesion Classification using CNN

The project focuses on developing a skin disease classifier to analyze people’s skin disease. This is basically for people that are not in a condition to meet the dermatologist in person and do the tests that are really expensive it may be because they are poor or they simply don’t have the time to consult a doctor in the first place. The objective is to create a classifier that utilizes CNN and MobileNetV2 for Skin lesions classification and to provide recommendations for remedies or further consultation.
