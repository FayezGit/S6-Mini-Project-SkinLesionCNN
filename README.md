# Skin Lesion Classification using CNN

This project focuses on developing a skin disease classifier to analyze people’s skin disease. This project mainly focus on people that are not in a condition to meet the dermatologist in person and do the tests that are really expensive it may be because they are poor or they simply don’t have the time to consult a doctor in the first place. Our project ensures that even the people with less technical can use our services and find the results. The objective is to create a classifier that utilizes CNN and MobileNetV2 for Skin lesions classification and provide remedies for it.
