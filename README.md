# Skin Lesion Classification using CNN

The project focuses on developing a skin disease classifier to analyze peopleâ€™s skin diseases. This is for individuals who are unable to meet a dermatologist in person due to financial constraints or time limitations. The objective is to create a classifier that utilizes CNN and MobileNetV2 for skin lesion classification and to provide recommendations for remedies or further consultation.

## Training the Model

There are two Jupyter notebooks provided for training the model:

- **SkinLesionAnalyzer.ipynb**: This notebook is for training the model from scratch and includes data setup.
- **SkinLesionAnalyzerWithLoadingModel.ipynb**: This notebook is for continuing training using a saved model, which was initially trained using the first notebook.

***Instructions***

1. **Create a Google Drive folder** called **'Skin Lesion Project'**.
2. **Upload the dataset** (zipped) into the **'Skin Lesion Project'** folder.
3. **Extract the dataset** into a folder named **'HAM1000'** inside the **'Skin Lesion Project'** folder.
4. **Run the first notebook** (**SkinLesionAnalyzer.ipynb**) to set up the data and train the model from scratch.
5. **Run the second notebook** (**SkinLesionAnalyzerWithLoadingModel.ipynb**) if you wish to continue training with a previously saved model.  
   - This notebook will only work after completing the first one, as it requires the setup from the first notebook.
