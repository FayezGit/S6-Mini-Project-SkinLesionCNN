# Skin Lesion Classification using CNN

The project focuses on developing a skin disease classifier to analyze people’s skin disease. This is basically for people that are not in a condition to meet the dermatologist in person and do the tests that are really expensive it may be because they are poor or they simply don’t have the time to consult a doctor in the first place. The objective is to create a classifier that utilizes CNN and MobileNetV2 for Skin lesions classification and to provide recommendations for remedies or further consultation.

## Training the Model

There are two Jupyter notebooks provided for training the model:

- **SkinLesionAnalyzer.ipynb**: This notebook is for training the model from scratch and includes data setup.
- **SkinLesionAnalyzerWithLoadingModel.ipynb**: This notebook is for continuing training using a saved model, which was initially trained using the first notebook.

***Instructions***

1. **Create a Google Drive folder** called **'Skin Lesion Project'**.
2. **Upload the dataset** (zipped) into the **'Skin Lesion Project'** folder.
3. **Extract the dataset** into a folder named **'HAM1000'** inside the **'Skin Lesion Project'** folder.
4. **Run the first notebook** (**SkinLesionAnalyzer.ipynb**) to set up the data and train the model from scratch.
5. **Run the second notebook** (**SkinLesionAnalyzerWithLoadingModel.ipynb**) if you wish to continue training with a previously saved model.  
   - This notebook will only work after completing the first one, as it requires the setup from the first notebook.
